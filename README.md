# Admin-Dashboard project-7

## Project Overview
This project is a basic web page layout created using HTML and CSS. It comprises a main container divided into a left sidebar, a header, and a main content area. The layout appears to be designed for a dashboard-style web application.

## HTML Structure
The HTML structure of the project is as follows:

1. `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declares the document type and version of HTML.
2. `<html lang="en">`: The root element of the HTML document with the specified language attribute.
3. `<head>`: Contains metadata about the document and links to external resources such as stylesheets and images.
   - `<meta>`: Specifies the character set and viewport settings.
   - `<title>`: Sets the title of the web page.
   - `<style>`: Embedded CSS styles for styling the page.
4. `<body>`: Contains the visible content of the web page.

## CSS Styling
The CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style the HTML elements. Here are key CSS classes and their purposes:

- `.main-container`: Defines the main container of the page with specific dimensions and a border.
- `.sidebar`: Styles the left sidebar with a gradient background and specific dimensions.
- `.header`: Styles the header section with a gradient background and a grid layout.
- `.con`: Styles the main content area with a gradient background.
- `.right`: Styles a sub-container within the main content area with a grid layout.
- `.box`: Styles individual boxes within the grid with borders, alignment, and shadows.
- `.new`: Styles the buttons in the header.
- `.part-1`: Styles a section within the right sidebar.
- `.para`, `.community`, `.update`: Styles text elements within the right sidebar.
- `.icon`: Styles the icons in the left sidebar.

## HTML Elements and Components
- The left sidebar (`<div class="sidebar">`) contains a list of navigation links represented by `<div>` elements with icons.
- The header (`<div class="header">`) contains a search bar, user profile information, and buttons.
- The main content area (`<div class="con">`) displays a title and a grid of boxes with project information.
- The right sidebar (`<div class="right">`) is divided into two parts (`<div class="h1">` and `<div class="h2">`) containing announcements and other content.
- Each box within the grid in the main content area represents a project with a title and description.

## Additional Notes
- The project uses gradients and background images for visual appeal.
- Images (e.g., logo, icons) are linked in the HTML using `<img>` elements.
